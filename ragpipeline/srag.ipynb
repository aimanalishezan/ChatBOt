       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'speech.txt'}, page_content='The world must be made safe for democracy. Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty. We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them.\\n\\nJust because we fight without rancor and without selfish object, seeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples, we shall, I feel confident, conduct our operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and of fair play we profess to be fighting for.\\n\\n…\\n\\nIt will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus, not in enmity toward a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck. We are, let me say again, the sincere friends of the German people, and shall desire nothing so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between us—however hard it may be for them, for the time being, to believe that this is spoken from our hearts.\\n\\nWe have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that friendship—exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible. We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions toward the millions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy who live among us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it toward all who are in fact loyal to their neighbors and to the government in the hour of test. They are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance. They will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose. If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with with a firm hand of stern repression; but, if it lifts its head at all, it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few.\\n\\nIt is a distressing and oppressive duty, gentlemen of the Congress, which I have performed in thus addressing you. There are, it may be, many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us. It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts—for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.\\n\\nTo such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured. God helping her, she can do no other.')]"

It is part of the Rangpur Division and borders India to the west.[3] It was established as a mahakuma in 1860 consisting of 7 thanas named Thakurgaon sadar, Baliadangi, Pirganj, Ranishankail, Haripur,bhulli and Ruhia. In 1947, it was re-established as a mahakuma including 3 thanas of Jalpaiguri and a thana of kochbihar of India. In 1981, Atoari was included in the new Panchagarh district and the area was shrunk in just 5 thanas. It was established as a district on 1 February 1984.[4]\\n\\n\\nSubdistricts[edit]\\nThere are 5 upazilas, 6 thanas, 53 unions, 647 mouzas and 1,016 villages in Thakurgaon. The Upazilas in the district are:\\n\\nThakurgaon Sadar Upazila\\nBaliadangi Upazila\\nHaripur Upazila\\nRanisankail Upazila\\nPirganj Upazila\\nThere is also an upazila named Pirganj under Rangpur district. \\n\\nEtymology[edit]\\nWhile there was no evidence that Thakurgaon was once named Nishchintapur, assumptions were made based on the similarity between the names. The mausoleum and the name Nukchintapur were considered as potential references to Thakurgaon\\'s earlier name, Nischintinpur. Yet, confirmation came when historical maps from the 17th century depicted two distinct locations: Atitkurgaon and Nishchintpur. Nishchintpur was positioned at the eastern end of Tanganni and partly on the west side of the Tangan river in the north-west. Thakurgaon was situated from the 4th to the 4th, indicating that the name of Thakurgaon\\'s sadar was originally Nishchinpura at the eastern end of the Tangan river. Over time, Nishchinpura evolved into Thakurgaon, encompassing the entire subdivision initially known as Thathakuranga and later adopting the identity of the district.\\nHistorical records reveal that the current district headquarters of Thakurgaon has its roots in a location 8 kilometers north of Akecha Union, where two brothers named Narayan Chakraborty and Satish Chakraborti resided. Known for their wealth and influence, the locals referred to their house as Thakurbari. Chakrabarti house eventually lent its name to the area, transitioning from Thakurbari to Thakurgaon. Recognizing the need for a police station, the Chakrabarti brothers sought approval from the British government, leading to the establishment of a police station in the early 1800s, named Thakurgaon thana. Subsequently, the thana was relocated to the Tangon river due to various reasons, and in 1860, Thakurgaon subdivision was formed with 10 thanas. The district, officially named Thakurgaon with five thanas, was marked on the map of Bangladesh on February 1, 1984. Despite its recent establishment as a district, the region boasts an ancient history and cultural significance. [5]\\n\\nHistory[edit]\\nThe Monument of 1971 War beside Tangon River.\\nDuring British rule Thakurgaon was a tehsil (a district subdivision). In 1947 at the time of the Partition of India, Thakurgaon Subdivision became part of the newly established Dinajpur District of East Bengal. In 1984 Thakurgaon subdivision was split off Dinajpur and became a separate district (i.e. Thakurgaon District). Before 1879 Thakurgaon District was ruled by  Maithil Brahmin and Bengali Brahmin Thakurs like Bikhash Jha, Barun Thakur and Vidhenesh Roy. Until 1947 Thakurgaon district had a just Hindu majority population of 52%. Most people believe Thakurgaon district has got its name from Barun Thakur. \\nDuring the British period in 1800, a Tagore family initiative led to the formation of Thangur, Shuk, Kulik, Patharaj, and Dhapa widows near the present municipality area. This gave rise to the Thakurgaon Thana, named after these entities. In 1860, it was declared as a sub-division with six police stations. In 1947, Thakurgaon became a subdivision, absorbing 10 thanas from Jalpaiguri district and one from Kotwihar. However, in 1981, Thakurgaon\\'s geographical boundaries changed, resulting in five thanas in a separate Panchagarh district.[6]\\n\\nEthnography[edit]\\nThe ethnographic makeup of the Thakurgaon district population shares similarities with the broader characteristics of Bangladesh. However, due to the diverse composition of this township\\'s population, a multitude of ethno-characteristics are evident. Notably, the district hosts significant numbers of the three main language groups in the Indian subcontinent: Indo-European, Dravidian, and Munda. Additionally, a considerable population belonging to the \\'Bodo\\' language group has established itself in the district.\\nThe demographic landscape of Thakurgaon encompasses Hindu and Muslim majorities, along with communities such as Santal, Munda, Onrao, Koch, Polia, Rajvanshi, Ho, Mahto, Malo, Kukamar, Hari, Bhuiyan, Gangkhu, among others. The ethnographic foundation of Thakurgaon district is shaped by the amalgamation of these diverse groups.\\nThe populations of Bangladesh exhibit varied physical traits, including long mouths, broad noses, and fall into three main categories: Longmund, Long and Middle Nasa, Egypto-Asiatic or Melanid, and specifically Golmund, Advanced Nasa, Alpine or Eastern Brachyd. [7]\\n\\nGeography[edit]\\nThe area of Thakurgaon is 1,781.74 square kilometres (687.93\\xa0sq\\xa0mi). Thakurgaon is in the north west corner of Bangladesh, it is about 467\\xa0km from Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. It is surrounded by Dinajpur district on its south, Panchagarh district to the east and India on its west and north sides, it is a part of the Himalayan plain land. Highest average temperature of this district is 33.5\\xa0°C and lowest average is 10.05\\xa0°C.[8]\\n\\nDemographics[edit]\\nHistorical populationYearPop.±% p.a.1974 633,331—\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa01981 817,732+3.72%1991 1,010,948+2.14%2001 1,214,376+1.85%2011 1,390,042+1.36%2022 1,533,895+0.90%Sources:[9][10]\\nAccording to the 2022 Census of Bangladesh, Thakurgaon District had 382,400 households and a population of 1,533,895, of whom, 18.58% of the inhabitants lived in urban areas. The population density was 861 people per km2. The literacy rate (age 7 and over) was 74.38%, compared to the national average of 74.80%. The ethnic population was 15,511.[1][10]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReligions in Thakurgaon District (2022)[10]\\n\\nReligion\\n\\nPercent\\n\\n\\nMuslims\\n\\u2009\\n77.04%\\n\\n\\nHindus\\n\\u2009\\n22.14%\\n\\n\\nChristianity\\n\\u2009\\n0.63%\\n\\n\\nOther or not stated\\n\\u2009\\n0.19%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReligion in present-day Thakurgaon District[a]\\n\\n\\nReligion\\n\\nPopulation (1941)[11]:\\u200a88–89\\u200a\\n\\nPercentage (1941)\\n\\nPopulation (2022)[10]\\n\\nPercentage (2022)\\n\\n\\nIslam \\n\\n144,366\\n\\n47.20%\\n\\n1,181,774\\n\\n77.04%\\n\\n\\nHinduism \\n\\n155,554\\n\\n51.96%\\n\\n339,580\\n\\n22.14%\\n\\n\\nTribal religion\\n\\n5,627\\n\\n1.65%\\n\\n2,782\\n\\n0.18%\\n\\n\\nChristianity \\n\\n453\\n\\n0.13%\\n\\n9,615\\n\\n0.63%\\n\\n\\nOthers [b]\\n\\n181\\n\\n0.06%\\n\\n144\\n\\n0.01%\\n\\n\\nTotal Population\\n\\n325,181\\n\\n100%\\n\\n1,533,895\\n\\n100%\\n\\nMuslims make up 77.04% of the population, while Hindus are 22.14% and Christians 0.63% of the population.[10]\\n\\nEconomy[edit]\\nIn Bangladesh, agriculture serves as the foundation of the economy, and Thakurgaon has long been striving for economic productivity, with agriculture playing a significant role in the district\\'s economy. Thakurgaon produces a variety of agricultural products, including rice, wheat, sugarcane, seasonal vegetables, and fruits. The sugarcane plantation, known as TSM (Thakurgaon Sugar Mill), is part of the BSFIC, becoming a primary source of livelihood for the locals. Poultry farms are a thriving business in Thakurgaon, and the district is equipped with several cold stores. Various businesses focused on the production and repair of agricultural tools have also emerged in the area. \\nThe contribution of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in the rural economy of Thakurgaon has been significant. Notably, organizations like ESDO and RDRS have received widespread acclaim for their efforts in poverty alleviation, particularly in enhancing the income and employment prospects of both men and women in Thakurgaon. RDRS, particularly in the immediate aftermath of independence, garnered praise for its relief and rehabilitation activities, while ESDO\\'s initiatives in micro-credit, child education, literacy, and integrated community development since the 90s have generated substantial employment opportunities for the economically disadvantaged, especially women. Moreover, the proactive measures taken by NGOs in promoting social and health awareness have played a pivotal role in contributing to the overall economy of the region.[12]\\nHowever, the community\\'s distance from the capital poses challenges in obtaining adequate technical and logistical support and in transporting local products to the national market. It is not easy for investors to establish businesses far away from the center of national trade and commerce. Despite these challenges, Thakurgaon is experiencing rapid development. Some business groups, such as the Younis Group and Kazi Farm, have initiated investments in Thakurgaon. With these developments, the agriculture-based district is expected to transform into an industrial hub in the near future. \\n\\nPlaces of interest[13][edit]\\nNagor River at Haripur upazila\\nThere are various places of interest in the district, these include:\\n\\nThe Tangon River\\nSenua Bridge\\nOld Airport, destroyed during the second world war, situated at Modergonj beside of Arazipaickpara\\nJomidar Mosjid at Shibganj\\nBalia Mosjid at Balia Union\\nThe Fair of Nekmordon\\nRamrai Dighi, it is a pond having 50 acres (200,000\\xa0m2) of area.

Muslims observe ceremonies such as Eid-al-Fitr, Eid-al- Azha, Miladunnabi, Muharram (Ashura), and Shab-e- Barat. Meanwhile, Hindus partake in numerous pujas, including Durga Puja, Kali Puja, Lakshmi Puja, Bhiphunda, Saraswati Puja, Chadak Puja, Rasajatra, Doljatra, and Janmastami. Additionally, New Year celebrations, Nabanna, and Paush Sankranti are embraced by all communities. \\nThe Milad ceremony among Muslims marks auspicious beginnings and joyful news. Notably, significant occasions like Eid, Durgapuja, Laxmi Puja, Saraswati Puja witness the harmonious interaction between Hindus and Muslims, as both communities visit each other\\'s courtrooms and extend invitations. Moreover, celebrations such as marriages, Akika, Khatna, birthdays, Annaprashan, and more are occasions where people from diverse religious backgrounds come together. Thakurgaon exemplifies a community where religion does not serve as a barrier.\\nBeyond religious festivals, certain cultural practices have become ingrained in the local folk culture. Enjoying bread or rice in the evening, playing traditional musical instruments or participating in Tazia processions are not confined to specific religious festivals; instead, they have evolved to become integral parts of the region\\'s cultural tapestry. On the occasion of the New Year, engaging in bird and fish hunting, sharing meals with fellow community members, consuming traditional foods like nuts and betel leaves, and partaking in cultural activities are common practices embraced by people of all backgrounds in Thakurgaon.[14]\\nIn bygone eras, Thakurgaon saw the widespread use of traditional utensils crafted from materials such as pottery, including dishes, lids, tawas, gastars, and items like Dixie, karail, bowls, glasses, spoons, iron pans, and bamboo lacaris or clay lahhi, dies, or duars for pulses. These age-old utensils are still in use today. However, the culinary landscape has evolved over time, witnessing the prevalence of tin, subsequently steel, and, in contemporary times, melamine utensils among the general populace. Glass and chinaware adorn the tables of esteemed households, adding to the overall dining experience. Traditional spice grinding tools, such as stone shilpatas or Haman dithas, were once commonplace and are still retained.\\nIn rural settings, rice was traditionally pounded in potholes or chham-gahins. Women in impoverished families not only ground rice for their own consumption but also received remuneration in the form of additional rice or other essentials. This practice enabled them to create items like chira, mudi, khaoi, serving as a vital means of sustenance for many disadvantaged women. However, this once-thriving profession has gradually diminished, with the advent of electricity leading to the establishment of numerous small and large rice mills in villages.\\nToday, the market serves as a primary source for obtaining rice, chilis, twigs, rice flour, and spices such as green chili, and turmeric powder. Consequently, women who were previously engaged in rice processing have transitioned into roles as agricultural laborers, reflecting the changing dynamics of livelihoods in Thakurgaon.[15]\\n\\nThere is a versatile practice of culture in the district; few festivals and cultural events are regularly arranged there. Alpona Sansad arranges Boishakhi Mela in every Bangla new year. Held \"Eid Fair\" at the occasion of Eid-Ul-Adha & Eid-Ul-Fitre every year at Thakurgaon Boro Matth also.  Several drama clubs (Sapla Natto Gosty-Estd.1974, Nischintopur Theater-1983 etc. ) practice and perform regularly and stage original and famous dramas every month. Dhamer Gaan is a unique traditional cultural invention of Thakurgaon people. The existing 10 tribes in this area enjoy their own heritage and cultural practices.Eid Ul Adha\\nNotable people[edit]\\nMirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir Former member of the parliament and Secretary general of Bangladesh Nationalist Party\\nRamesh Chandra Sen Member of parliament\\nShishir Bhattacharjee Painter, cartoonist\\nLitu Anam Actor and Television personality\\nDabirul Islam 7-term Member of parliament of Awami league\\nShirin Akter Shila Model and beauty pageant\\nGallery[edit]\\n\\n\\n\\nShuk River at Thakurgaon Sadar Upazila \\n\\n\\n\\nPlayground of Thakurgaon\\n\\n\\n\\nTangon River from Tangon Bridge\\n\\n\\n\\nKulik River at westside of Ranisankail Upazila\\n\\n\\n\\nAmai Pond at Haripur Upazila parishad\\n\\n\\n\\nA science building of Thakurgaon Govt.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'attention.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='1 Introduction\\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [ 13] and gated recurrent [ 7] neural networks\\nin particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\\ntransduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [ 35,2,5]. Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z= (z1, ..., z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'attention.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [ 11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer( x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3'),\n",

(right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\\nattention layers running in parallel.\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1√dk.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qandkare independent random\\nvariables with mean 0and variance 1. Then their dot product, q·k=Pdk\\ni=1qiki, has mean 0and variance dk.\\n4'),\n",

For each of these we use\\ndk=dv=dmodel/h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n•In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN( x) = max(0 , xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff= 2048 .\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i)=sin(pos/100002i/d model)\\nPE(pos,2i+1)=cos(pos/100002i/d model)\\nwhere posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto10000 ·2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., z n), with xi, zi∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6'),\n",

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+n·d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [ 38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [ 20] with β1= 0.9,β2= 0.98andϵ= 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate =d−0.5\\nmodel·min(step_num−0.5, step _num·warmup _steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup _steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup _steps = 4000 .\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'),\n",

We present these results in Table 3.\\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,\\nkeeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head\\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dkhurts model quality. This\\nsuggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility\\nfunction than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,\\nbigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our\\nsinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [ 9], and observe nearly identical\\nresults to the base model.\\n6.3 English Constituency Parsing\\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English\\nconstituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [ 25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor .\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1]Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.
